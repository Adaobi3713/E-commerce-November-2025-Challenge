# E-commerce-November-2025-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Onyx Data November Challenge (DataDNA).
The challenge involved analyzing a rich E-Commerce Sales Performance dataset to uncover insights around customer loyalty, revenue trends, product performance, and global sales distribution.

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into clear, actionable business insights.

Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to explore how customers interact with the platform, identify top-performing sales channels and products, measure repeat-purchase behavior, and understand the revenue landscape across different regions.

The report provides a full breakdown of:

Revenue performance by month, channel, and country

Loyal customer behavior and repeat-purchase trends

Top/Bottom performing products

Discount code usage

Refund patterns

Customer wait time before second purchase

Average selling price and tax

Geographic distribution of sales

Key Insights Uncovered

Overall Performance
Total Net Revenue: $31.8M

Unique Customers: 4,000

Loyal Customer Events: 48,000 repeat-purchase instances

Total Quantity Sold: 289,274

Average Selling Price: $663

Average Tax: $66

Customer Loyalty & Behavior

Customers waited an average of 41 days before making their second purchase.

Loyal customers frequently used discount codes like WELCOME10, NEWCUSTOMER10, and BFCM10.

Website customers showed the strongest repeat-purchase behavior.

Channel Performance

Direct Sales and Resellers followed as strong contributors.

Refunds were generally low, but certain channels showed higher refund volumes.

Product Insights

Top performers include:
